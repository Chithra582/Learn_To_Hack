Examples of metadata include:

    1.Date and time the file was created

    2.Camera or device used

    3.GPS location

    4.Author or software name

What is ExifTool Used For?

     1.ExifTool is mainly used in:

     2.OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

     3.Digital forensics

     4.Image and file analysis

Checking hidden or sensitive information in files
      It helps investigators understand where, when, and how a file was created or modified.

What Can Be Done Using ExifTool?

With ExifTool, we can:

    1.View full metadata of a file

    2.Find GPS location from images

    3.Identify camera or device details

    4.Check editing history

    5.Remove metadata for privacy

Installing ExifTool (Linux)
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl

How to Use ExifTool (With Examples)
