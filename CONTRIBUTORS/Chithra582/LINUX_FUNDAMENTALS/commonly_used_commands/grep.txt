Command Name: grep

Description:
grep (Global Regular Expression Print) is a powerful Linux command used to search for specific
patterns or strings inside files or command outputs. It is widely used in CTFs and cybersecurity
for log analysis, finding credentials, flags, IPs, and suspicious patterns.

Basic Syntax:
grep [options] "pattern" file_name

Example:
grep "admin" users.txt

Useful Flags:

-i
Ignores case sensitivity while searching.
Example:
grep -i "password" data.txt

-r
Searches recursively through directories.
Example:
grep -r "flag{" /home/user/

-n
Displays the line number where the match is found.
Example:
grep -n "error" logs.txt

-v
Inverts the match and shows lines that do NOT contain the pattern.
Example:
grep -v "root" users.txt

-w
Searches for the exact word only.
Example:
grep -w "admin" users.txt

-l
Displays only the filenames that contain the match.
Example:
grep -l "password" *.txt

Common CTF Use Case:
Used to quickly locate flags, credentials, IP addresses, or keywords from large files or directories.
Example:
grep -r "FLAG{" .
